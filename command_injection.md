## Types of Command Injection

1. **In-band Command Injection:**
   - Consists of an attacker executing commands on the host operating system via a vulnerable application and receiving the response of the command in the application.

2. **Blind Command Injection:**
   - Consists of an attacker executing commands on the host operating system via a vulnerable application that does not return the output from the command within its HTTP response.
